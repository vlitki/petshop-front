# Petshop

## About
- practice project
- a small e-commerce app that displays cat and dog products
- technology used: ReactJS, Strapi CMS, Heroku 


### Link
https://petcommerz.netlify.app/

### Note about the link:
- I managed to deploy the site on Heroku (link above), but I am still figuring out how to prevent images from disappearing. I know I need them to upload via Cloudinary or AWS but I am not sure how to integrate that in my application. (not really familiar with deploying and that stuff, still learning).

#### Here are the screenshots of how the app looks locally:

- improve the styling (fonts, buttons) 
- add additional features in product details page(comments, rating, reviews...)
- make the app responsive
- style the cart component
- add some animations
